# ðŸ•’ **How much time will it take?**

| Your Study Time | How Long Youâ€™ll Need |  
|:----------------|:----------------------|  
| 2-3 Hours/day    | 10-12 Months           |  
| 4-5 Hours/day    | 6-8 Months             |  
| Full-Time (6-8h/day) | 4-6 Months       |  

**Consistency** matters more than speed.  
**Action Plan** + **Projects** = Success. ðŸš€
