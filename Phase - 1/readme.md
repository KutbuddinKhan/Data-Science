## üêç **Python Basics Lesson 1: Introduction**

Python is the most used language in Data Science because:
- It's simple and readable
- Huge libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- Community support is massive

You will need:
- **Anaconda** Distribution (easier to install Python, Jupyter, and Libraries)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for running Python interactively)
- **VSCode or PyCharm** (optional IDEs)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Install Tools
- Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- Install it (Next -> Next -> Finish)
- Open **Anaconda Navigator**
- Launch **Jupyter Notebook** from there

**Tell me once you have installed Anaconda.** üëç

## üìù Write Your First Python Code (try in Jupyter):

```python
print("Hello, Future Data Scientist!")
```

# üéØ **Today's Interview Questions: (With solutions and deep explanations)**

### 1. What is Python? Why is it used in Data Science?
**Answer:**  
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax and large ecosystem of libraries.  
It is used in Data Science because it supports:
- Data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy)
- Machine learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

---
  
### 2. What is a Variable in Python?
**Answer:**  
A variable is a container that holds data in memory.

```python
x = 10
y = "Data Science"
```
Here, `x` holds an integer, `y` holds a string.

---

### 3. How do you comment in Python?
**Answer:**  
Use `#` for single-line comment:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello")  # This is also a comment
```
For multi-line comment, you can use triple quotes `''' or """`.

---

### 4. What are the basic data types in Python?
**Answer:**
- `int` ‚Äì Integer numbers ‚Üí `10`
- `float` ‚Äì Decimal numbers ‚Üí `10.5`
- `str` ‚Äì Text ‚Üí `"Data"`
- `bool` ‚Äì True/False ‚Üí `True`

---

### 5. What is a List in Python?
**Answer:**  
A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "data", 4.5]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
```

---

### 6. What is the difference between List and Tuple?
**Answer:**
| List | Tuple |
|---|---|
| Mutable (can change) | Immutable (cannot change) |
| Use `[ ]` | Use `( )` |

Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

---

### 7. What is indentation in Python?
**Answer:**  
Indentation (spaces/tabs) defines code blocks.  
Example:

```python
if True:
    print("Indented block")
```

If indentation is wrong, Python will give an error.

---

### 8. How to install a Python library?
**Answer:**  
Use `pip` (Python package installer).

```bash
pip install pandas
```
(Anaconda manages libraries automatically for you.)

---

### 9. What is Jupyter Notebook?
**Answer:**  
It is an interactive tool to write and run Python code, visualize data, and make notes‚Äîall in one place (great for Data Science).

---

### 10. How to print multiple items in Python?
**Answer:**

```python
print("Hello", "World", 123)
```
Output: `Hello World 123`
