---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Python data structures: `list`, `dict`
- Functions and modular design
- Input validation and user-friendly CLI
- Basic use of `sum()`, loops, and conditionals
- Clean code structure using `if __name__ == "__main__"`

## 🎯 Real-World Relevance

This type of basic data-entry system mimics many **backend admin tools** used in education, HR, and customer management. The logic behind it forms the foundation of **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which are core to **database management** and **web APIs**.

---

## 🧱 Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiple grades per student
- Save and load student data to a file (using CSV or JSON)
- Add unique student IDs
- Export student list to `.csv`
